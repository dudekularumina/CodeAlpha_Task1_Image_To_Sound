# CodeAlpha_Task1_Image_To_Sound

Image To Sound: To convert from Image to Sound , first we have to convert the image into text and then to sound using gTTS.
==============

The pytesseract module in Python, which is a Python wrapper for the Tesseract OCR (Optical Character Recognition) engine.

What is Tesseract OCR:
======================
Tesseract OCR is an open-source optical character recognition engine developed by Google. It is designed to convert scanned documents, images, or handwritten text into machine-readable text. Tesseract is highly accurate and supports various languages and scripts.

pytesseract module:
===================
To use Tesseract in Python, you can make use of the pytesseract python library, which is a Python wrapper for Tesseract. Here's an overview of how to use it:


How to install and Use the pytesseract module:
=============================================
(1)r"C:\\Program Files\\tesseract.exe" add the path of the downloded tessaract for windows on your PC.

(2)we have to import the modules:
# import cv2
opencv---------> import cv2 
                 from OpenCV is a Python library that allows you to perform image processing. cv2 is a package in opencv-python
                 It provides a wide range of features, including object detection, face recognition, and tracking
                 
# from gtts import gTTS                 
gTTS-----------> The gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) library is a powerful tool for converting text to speech in Python. 
                 With gTTS, you can easily add speech functionality to your Python scripts, allowing you to create audio files from any text.
                 
# import pytesseract                 
pytesseract----> Pytesseract or Python-tesseract is an OCR tool for python that also serves as a wrapper for the Tesseract-OCR Engine. 
                 It can read and recognize text in images and is commonly used in python ocr image to text use cases.

# import os                 
os module------> Accessing File, to handle files in current directory,
                 Python has a built-in os module with methods for interacting with the operating system, 
                 like creating files and directories, management of files and directories, input, output, environment variables, process management
